# skera

`skera` is a Rust library and binary for subsetting a font file according to provided input.

Use `--keep-everything` or the library's `Plan::keep_everything` to select all
glyphs, Unicode mappings, names, layout items, and tables. The preset also
preserves glyph names, legacy naming records, the `.notdef` outline, and
Unicode range bits. CLI list operations then tailor those selections in command
line order, while boolean flags and custom glyph mappings add to the preset.
Tables are still subset and can be optimized or re-encoded.

CFF1 and CFF2 outlines support subsetting with retained subroutines, optional
desubroutinization (`--desubroutinize`), hint removal (`--no-hinting`), and
retained glyph IDs (`--retain-gids`). CFF1 subsetting includes CID fonts,
custom and expert encodings, glyph names, and `seac` component closure.
Retained-subroutine output requires each call's subroutine number to be an
immediately preceding literal in the same program. Fonts using caller-supplied
or computed targets require `--desubroutinize`; retained mode rejects them.
Hint removal flattens individual glyphs when deleting their operands or changing
caller-dependent mask boundaries would modify a shared program.

Use `--text` (or `-t`) to select Unicode characters directly from UTF-8 text.
Text and Unicode selectors share the same selection set and support ordered
replacement, addition (`+=`), and removal (`-=`) operations.

MATH subsetting retains the variants and assembly parts of selected glyphs,
remaps their references, and preserves constants, per-glyph math values,
kerning and device adjustments.

## Installation

### Library

To use `skera` in your Rust project, add it via `cargo`:

```bash
cargo add skera
```

### CLI

To install the `skera` command-line tool, use `cargo install` with the `cli` feature enabled:

```bash
cargo install skera --features cli
```

## Usage

### CLI

To subset a font using the command-line tool:

```bash
skera --path <INPUT_PATH> --unicodes <UNICODES> --output-file <OUTPUT_PATH>
```

For a full list of available options and flags, run:

```bash
skera --help
```

## Profiling

How-To: Profile a Skera Binary using Samply

### Prerequisites
Install samply using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install samply
```

### Step 1: Enable Debug Symbols in Release Profiles
Add the following configuration to your root Cargo.toml:

```bash
[profile.release]
debug = true
```

### Step 2: Compile your crate using the release profile with the cli feature:

```bash
cargo build --release -p skera --features="cli"
```

### Step 3: Record and Profile the Binary
Run the generated release executable using samply record. Replace <bin> with your compiled binary's name and <args...> with any execution arguments:

```bash
samply record target/release/skera <args...>
```

example:

```bash
samply record target/release/skera font-file --unicodes=* --output-file=out
```

### Step 4: Analyze the Results
Once your binary finishes execution, samply automatically starts a local web server and prints a URL to the console:
```bash
Server listening on http://127.0.0.1:3000
Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

Open the provided link in your web browser.
The browser will open the Firefox Profiler interface, populated with your recorded run's call tree, flame graph, and timeline views.

### Alternative Profiling Tools
If samply is not suitable for your target environment, you may consider these alternative options:

cargo-flamegraph: A tool that utilizes perf (on Linux) or dtrace (on macOS) to generate a static vector-graphic .svg flame graph.

```bash
cargo install cargo-flamegraph
cargo flamegraph -p skera --features="cli"
```

perf (Linux-only): The standard system profiler on Linux, useful for command-line profiling and capturing kernel-level events.

```bash
perf record -g -- target/release/skera
perf report
```
