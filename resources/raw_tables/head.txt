    uint16	majorVersion	Major version number of the font header table — set to 1.
    uint16	minorVersion	Minor version number of the font header table — set to 0.
    Fixed	fontRevision	Set by font manufacturer.
    uint32	checksumAdjustment	To compute: set it to 0, sum the entire font as uint32, then store 0xB1B0AFBA - sum. If the font is used as a component in a font collection file, the value of this field will be invalidated by changes to the file structure and font table directory, and must be ignored.
    uint32	magicNumber	Set to 0x5F0F3CF5.
    uint16	flags See the flags enum
    uint16	unitsPerEm	Set to a value from 16 to 16384. Any value in this range is valid. In fonts that have TrueType outlines, a power of 2 is recommended as this allows performance optimizations in some rasterizers.
    LONGDATETIME	created	Number of seconds since 12:00 midnight that started January 1st 1904 in GMT/UTC time zone.
    LONGDATETIME	modified	Number of seconds since 12:00 midnight that started January 1st 1904 in GMT/UTC time zone.
    int16	xMin	Minimum x coordinate across all glyph bounding boxes.
    int16	yMin	Minimum y coordinate across all glyph bounding boxes.
    int16	xMax	Maximum x coordinate across all glyph bounding boxes.
    int16	yMax	Maximum y coordinate across all glyph bounding boxes.
    uint16	macStyle see somewhere else
    uint16	lowestRecPPEM	Smallest readable size in pixels.
    int16	fontDirectionHint	Deprecated (Set to 2).
    int16	indexToLocFormat	0 for short offsets (Offset16), 1 for long (Offset32).
    int16	glyphDataFormat	0 for current format.


# flags
# Bit 0: Baseline for font at y=0.

# Bit 1: Left sidebearing point at x=0 (relevant only for TrueType rasterizers) — see the note below regarding variable fonts.

# Bit 2: Instructions may depend on point size.

# Bit 3: Force ppem to integer values for all internal scaler math; may use fractional ppem sizes if this bit is clear. It is strongly recommended that this be set in hinted fonts.

# Bit 4: Instructions may alter advance width (the advance widths might not scale linearly).

# Bit 5: This bit is not used in OpenType, and should not be set in order to ensure compatible behavior on all platforms. If set, it may result in different behavior for vertical layout in some platforms. (See Apple’s specification for details regarding behavior in Apple platforms.)

# Bits 6–10: These bits are not used in Opentype and should always be cleared. (See Apple’s specification for details regarding legacy used in Apple platforms.)

# Bit 11: Font data is “lossless” as a result of having been subjected to optimizing transformation and/or compression (such as e.g. compression mechanisms defined by ISO/IEC 14496-18, MicroType Express, WOFF 2.0 or similar) where the original font functionality and features are retained but the binary compatibility between input and output font files is not guaranteed. As a result of the applied transform, the DSIG table may also be invalidated.

# Bit 12: Font converted (produce compatible metrics).

# Bit 13: Font optimized for ClearType™. Note, fonts that rely on embedded bitmaps (EBDT) for rendering should not be considered optimized for ClearType, and therefore should keep this bit cleared.

# Bit 14: Last Resort font. If set, indicates that the glyphs encoded in the 'cmap' subtables are simply generic symbolic representations of codepoint ranges and don’t truly represent support for those codepoints. If unset, indicates that the glyphs encoded in the 'cmap' subtables represent proper support for those codepoints.

# Bit 15: Reserved, set to 0.

# mac style
# Bit 0: Bold (if set to 1);
# Bit 1: Italic (if set to 1)
# Bit 2: Underline (if set to 1)
# Bit 3: Outline (if set to 1) 
# Bit 4: Shadow (if set to 1)
# Bit 5: Condensed (if set to 1)
# Bit 6: Extended (if set to 1)
# Bits 7–15: Reserved (set to 0).

# font direction hint
# 0: Fully mixed directional glyphs;
# 1: Only strongly left to right;
# 2: Like 1 but also contains neutrals;
# -1: Only strongly right to left;
# -2: Like -1 but also contains neutrals.
# 
# (A neutral character has no inherent directionality; it is not a character with zero (0) width. Spaces and punctuation are examples of neutral characters. Non-neutral characters are those with inherent directionality. For example, Roman letters (left-to-right) and Arabic letters (right-to-left) have directionality. In a “normal” Roman font where spaces and punctuation are present, the font direction hints should be set to two (2).)
